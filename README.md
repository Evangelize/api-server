# Hapi Universal Redux
Fork from Rick Wong's [React Isomorphic Starterkit](https://github.com/RickWong/react-isomorphic-starterkit), with [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux) added to the isomorphic mix.

Isomorphic starterkit with server-side React rendering using 
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), 
[piping](https://github.com/mdlawson/piping), 
[webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), 
[webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server),
[hapi.js](http://www.hapijs.com/), 
[babel.js](http://babeljs.io/), 
[react.js](https://facebook.github.io/react), 
[redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux),
[react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), 
[react-hot-loader](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader), 
[react-transmit](https://github.com/RickWong/react-transmit),
[radium](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium)

## Features

- Fully automated with npm run scripts
- Server hot reloads with piping and Hapi.js
- Webpack for watch + production builds
- React.js + Router on the client and server
- React Hot Loader for instant client updates
- Babel.js automatically compiles ES6 + ES7
- React Transmit to preload on server to client
- Radium for styling components
- Redux for managing app state

It just works out-of-the-box.

```bash
	git clone https://github.com/luandro/hapi-universal-redux.git

	# production build and run
	NODE_ENV=production npm run build

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal and play with `views/Main.js` to get a feel of
the server-side rendering and client-side hot updates.
